#  QR Card task Instructions


## The task

Build out the QR card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible using HTML and CSS. 

Answer the short questions at the end of this document.


## Where to find everything

The images/assets you would need are contained in the "images" folder.

You can preview the design from the "desktop design" file

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a new public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and clone to your local machine. (create a Readme.md file while creating the repository)
2. Copy the images folder, style-guide.md file and design preview file in this folder to the folder you just cloned.
3. Look through the design to start planning out how you'll tackle the task. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content. remember to use "index.html".
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your webpage

1. After completing the design, push to github. Deploy the webpage using Github pages.
2. Copy the link to the published webpage and paste it in your readme.md file.
3. Write down the answers to the short questions at the end of this readme file in your own project's readme.md file. ( Use the format: 1. A,  2. B, 3. C etc)
